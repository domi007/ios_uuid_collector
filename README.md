iOS Device UUID Collector
=========================

If you need to provision a lot of devices into Apple's Developer Program you might want to do a simple batch upload of the UUIDs.
However collecting these UUID could be a pain if you want to do them one by one via iTunes. So here is a script that works on Ubuntu and possibly other Linux distributions. You just need to start the script with the required parameters and then connect the iOS devices right out of the box to your computer. The iOS device will boot up because it senses the USB power, the script will capture the UUID, and you can move onto the next device immediately. Easy, convenient.
